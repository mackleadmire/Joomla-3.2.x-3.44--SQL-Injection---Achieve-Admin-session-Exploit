 * # Exploit Title: Joomla 3.2.x - 3.4.4 - SQL Injection-Achieve Admin session Exploit
 * # Date: 19/11/2015
 * # Exploit Author: Lee
 * # Version: Joomla 3.2.x - 3.4.4
 * # Tested on: windows
 *
 * #Description:This is my first time of posting my exploit script,for this version which can achieve all the group sessions with new payloads.
 * Comparing with Manish Tanwar's exploit ,the admin user name and hashed password can be achieved ,but the admin session can be not which is the reason why I write this one.
 * For this script , we can get both super user session and administrator session at the same time.
 * If administrator has't login, it will send request every one minute until they login and log the session into TXT file.
 * If you want ,you can make a function mail it which can inform you timely!!!!
 * This is a particular dangerous one after getting admin sessions which means can get shell easily after achieve authority.
